# Python Units Conversion with TDD 
A units converter library demonstrating TDD with python. 
This units converter library contains the conversions from PSI to KPa, KPa to PSI, MPG to L/100km, and L/100km. 
Writing the code for this units conversion library took me a good amount of time, because I had to learn about how to do the TDD aspect which was something that we have not practiced really yet, but once I got the hang of it, it became pretty easy. 
I enjoyed working on this code because doing the unit conversions on stuff that is applicable to everday life and seeing how the code is actually written for these conversions is pretty fascinating.
